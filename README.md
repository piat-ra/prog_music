# Programmatic Music Generation

Programmatically generate music using the Sonic-Pi framework.

## Conceptual Layout of Song

A song is outlined in various conceptual units that are able to be programmatically generated.

### Mood

### Structure

### Chords

### Song Layers


## Control Surfaces

Each piece will have the design choices able to be selected by interfaceing with User controlled entities. These can be MIDI or electro-mechanical devices of any kind that are tied to values within the Sonic-Pi implementation.

In short, if there is a choice to be made, then that choice or range of opitions is mapped to a variable in Sonic-Pi. 
The selection of that choice is then subsequently tied to a real world selector, be it MIDI channel, OSC interface, analog hardware input, etc.
This enables the input choices made about the song layout able to be controlled via a range of user inputs...
